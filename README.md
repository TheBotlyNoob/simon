# Simon

The [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), built on an Arduino.

I don't feel like documenting the pin locations and what they do. Maybe check out the code? (Jay's is the most up to date)

## Versions

There are two versions of the code, one written by someone learning how to program and the other written by someone who has slightly more experience.

`src/main.cpp` is the version made by Jay Jackson, the person with more experience. This version contains sound, buzzer, and debugging code.

`sketch_ArduinoCodeSimon_ME/sketch_ArduinoCodeSimon_ME.ino` is the version made by Matthew Engel, the person learning Arduino. This only contains the light and button press logic.
